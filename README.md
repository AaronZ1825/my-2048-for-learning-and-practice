## This is my 2048 game, just for me to practice my C# and Unity skills.
**Notes**

It works as a normal 2048, but it has some interesting bugs, I think keep them there would be fun.
1. Sometimes you will find that blocks have collision volume. They will not be merged directly, but will be pasted together first.
2. The limit I designed is not 2048.
